<h1>Faith Masiello</h1>

<p class="info">My name is Faith and I am a 21 year old senior in the VCD program at EWU. My goal is to graduate in the spring of 2017, and I hope everything works out the way it should! I love nature photography, and I am a part of many fandoms, some of which include Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock (BBC), and many more. I can be nerdy at times (hence all the fandoms) and that's okay. I'm also shy and introverted, which I'm learning to embrace. I also love to read, write, and listen to music. I collect shot glasses and I think I have over 100 by now. I have a 16 year old mutt named Nellie and she's all black, but when the sun hits her just right, you can see brown swirls. I'm a huge Netflix binge watcher; the shows I've recently seen include Lost Girl, Blue Bloods, Royal Pains, and Haven. In the near future, I hope to use my photography skills to do freelance nature shots, or sell my own photos, either as single prints or in calendar format.</p>
<h2>Favorite Book</h2>
<p class="info">Although I saw the movie before reading the book, my favorite book would have to be Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert. Following a divorce and a crushing depression, Gilbert set out to examine three different aspects of her nature, set against the backdrop of three different cultures: pleasure in Italy, devotion in India, and on the Indonesian island of Bali, a balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. It's my favorite book because it tells the story of a woman who took her life back and made it her own. It's funny, inspiring, and I'd reccomend it to anyone.</p>

<h2>Favorite Meals</h2>
<h3>Pizza</h3>
<p class="info">Maybe it's the Italian in me, or maybe it's all the cheese, but I love pizza. I could eat a fresh slice nearly everyday. I prefer vegetarian toppings, but I'll take some pepperoni if it's given to me.</p>

<h3>Pasta</h3>
<p class="info">I guess it's the same with pizza, I could eat it everyday. I love all kinds of pasta, except maybe for whole wheat.</p>

<h3>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>
<p class="info">It's more of a snack than a meal, but these are my favorite type of cookies to make, and to eat. They're warm, gooey, and full of chocolate!</p>
